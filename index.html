              <p>
                Times have changed and with changing times, the sphere of school
                education still remains stuck in the past. With these changing
                times, have we at all, changed? Keeping up with the world and
                taking into account the concerns of parents and teachers alike,
                Edify helps you take the next step forward. The integration of
                our services not only makes our product unique but also gives us
                an edge over others. So what exactly do we do? Edify provides
                services that enhance the schooling experience for the students
                by providing or improving the online services through mobile
                application and website which are essential for the overall
                development of the child. We provide mechanisms to parents and
                teachers which help keep a regular check on the ward’s academic
                and non-academic progress.

                There are constant insecurities and concerns the parents have to
                deal with when their child is away from them, at school. The
                Edify team understands these concerns and provides methods to
                solve them. We have come up with a distinctive idea of recording
                the students movement in and out of their school and buses.
                Edify will help take virtual attendance of the students in the
                School and also in the bus, recording each entry and exit
                movement of theirs. Students’ school issued Identity cards will
                act as the medium to mark the virtual attendance. Parents will
                be notified about the movement of their child on the Edify app
                enabling safety and security of the students. This ensures that
                parents have nothing to worry about, and can send their ward to
                school more freely than ever before.

                Parents who have their children, going to school and coming
                home, from the school bus, face a completely different set of
                concerns. Edify will provide the Live tracking of the school bus
                which will allow the school authority and parents to track their
                child’s bus. GPS trackers will be installed in the school buses
                enabling edify app to project the live location of the bus. The
                app will indicate the estimated time of arrival of the bus to
                the pick up or the drop location, so that they do not have to
                wait unnecessarily at bus stops. This amps up the safety
                measures manifolds, as the bus can be completely monitored for
                its speed, route, estimated time of arrival etc.
