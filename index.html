            <p>
              Times have changed and with changing times, the sphere of school
              education still remains stuck in the past. With these changing
              times, have we at all, changed? Keeping up with the world and
              taking into account the concerns of parents and teachers alike,
              Edify helps you take the next step forward. The integration of our
              services not only makes our product unique but also gives us an
              edge over others. So what exactly do we do? Edify provides
              services that enhance the schooling experience for the students by
              providing or improving the online services through mobile
              application and website which are essential for the overall
              development of the child. We provide mechanisms to parents and
              teachers which help keep a regular check on the ward’s academic
              and non-academic progress.

                There are constant insecurities and concerns the parents have to
                deal with when their child is away from them, at school. The
                Edify team understands these concerns and provides methods to
                solve them. We have come up with a distinctive idea of recording
                the students movement in and out of their school and buses.
                Edify will help take virtual attendance of the students in the
                School and also in the bus, recording each entry and exit
                movement of theirs.

                Parents who have their children, going to school and coming
                home, from the school bus, face a completely different set of
                concerns. Edify will provide the Live tracking of the school bus
                which will allow the school authority and parents to track their
                child’s bus. GPS trackers will be installed in the school buses
                enabling edify app to project the live location of the bus. The
                app will indicate the estimated time of arrival of the bus to
                the pick up or the drop location, so that they do not have to
                wait unnecessarily at bus stops.

                The parents and the teachers’ major interaction is through the
                students alone. We plan to eliminate this barrier which may
                cause miscommunication and other problems, by linking the
                teachers and parents directly, through an app. Edify shall
                provide parents a constant view at the student’s academic
                progress. It shall provide the student with constant updates on
                their academics with E-Report card, and assignments. This will
                help the school in becoming paperless by sending assignments and
                report cards online via the Edify app.

                plan to bring an to this huge distance between the two. The

                convey their feedback, complaints and suggestions to the school
                as well as teachers. This way the school would be able to
                improve upon where it might be lacking, and would be able to
                understand the concern of the parents in a better and more
                wholesome way.
